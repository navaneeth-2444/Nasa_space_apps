3. **Responsive Design**
   - Smooth transitions between different sections of the page
   - Adaptive layout for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- D3.js for data visualization
- Web APIs for smooth animations and transitions

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
